            The Road Traveled and The Road To Come
        </h2>
        <p>I have lived an eventful life that has resulted in many miles traveled to various parts of the world. In 2000 I joined the U.S. Army where I was trained in the aviation field and also as a paratrooper. After multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, it was time for me to move on and try my hand in the civilian world.   
        </p>
        <p>Fourteen years later and after various jobs in law enforcement and militrary contracting I am finishing my senior year at The University of Montana and hope to be finished at the end of the fall 2024 semester or no later than spring 2025.
