This first assignment was a complete struggle. I did not retain much from MART341 as I have not tried anything with HTML since. What worked? Making a super basic page. What didn't work? Just about everything. I could not figure out hero images or even a generic background image. Without a level of structure or guidance it's difficult for me to retain code writing skills for HTML, CSS, and so on.

I am concerned at this point that I will spend more time trying to meet requirements for this class than what I can afford.
